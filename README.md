# Dice-cube

The idea behind the game is quite simple: A d6 gets thrown and it's score gets added to the first dice of the dice-cube. Once the first dice reaches 6 it resets back to 1 and increases the next dice by 1.
After the second dice reaches 6 it resets all previous dice back to 1 and increases the third dice by 1. This goes on and on until you fill out all the dice in the cube to become 6.

You can buy upgrades such as doubling of your score or an additional d6 (Maybe also other dice, like a d20 or a cheaper loaded dice that will always fall on 3, thus never being great but also never being bad.)


PRESTIGING: Prestiging would be handly through lines, squares and the cube itself. Each time you have for example five lines you could prestige to gain 5 line-points to spend on extra special upgrades.
Prestiging with a certain amount of squares would erase all line-based points and upgrades until you can afford to buy an upgrade which makes this undone.
